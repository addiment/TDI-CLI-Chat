// ----- Objects -----

// JavaScript has a concept called objects
// Objects, at their core, have KEYS and VALUES.
// Keys are words (like variable names) that have values associated with them.
// You can sorta think of objects like "variable containers."

let ourFirstObject = { // You can also do this on a single line, but doesn't this look nicer?
    "key": 100,
    anotherKey: "another value"
};
// You don't need quotation marks around keys.
// You do need them for values, though!

// Let's print out our object's properties using the "." operator:
console.log(ourFirstObject.key); // expected output: 100
// Here's accessing the other key:
console.log(ourFirstObject.anotherKey); // expected output: "anotherValue"

// ----- Everything is Objects! -----

// Remember those memes about cake from a few years ago,
// where people would cut into random objects with knives,
// only to reveal that the object was just a very well-made cake?

// That's JavaScript.

console.log(ourFirstObject); // expected output: { key: 100, anotherKey: 'another value' }

// We can print out objects just like variables...

// So, what if we did...
console.log(console); // Try this one yourself!

// So maybe, just maybe, we can...
console.log(console.log); // ????

// Objects are VARIABLES! Functions are OBJECTS! Functions are VARIABLES!

// Oh my.

// This might be a lot to take in. But don't worry, you'll get used to it.
// We can help you out if you're having trouble!
