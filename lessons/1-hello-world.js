// ----- Welcome to JavaScript! -----

// JavaScript is a programming language primarily used for making websites,
// making servers, scripting, and more.

// By this point, you should have node.js installed and added to your path.
// If you don't, ask us for help!

// ----- Flow -----

// JavaScript files execute from top to bottom (with a few exceptions).

// ----- Logging to the console -----

// Anywhere in your file you can access a **variable** called **console**. 
// We use the "console" object to access the JavaScript debug console.
// The log function is incredibly useful,
// it prints anything you put into it to the console.
console.log("Hello JavaScript!"); // expected output: "Hello JavaScript!" 
console.log("Hello", "JavaScript!", 300) // expected output: "Hello JavaScript! 300"
