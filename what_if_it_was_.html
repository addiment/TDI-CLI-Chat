    <h1>We're not doing this in HTML.</h1>
    <q>But why not???</q>
    <br>
    <p>Because:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It won't work without CSS.
            <ul>
                <li>We are not teaching CSS.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>We can't use TCP sockets in HTML5.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><q>But what about websockets???</q>
                <ul>
                    <li>Node doesn't have websocket support baked in.</li>
                    <li>I'm not gonna write the boilerplate for them.</li>
                    <li>We are NOT using NPM.</li>
                    <li>Browsers only like websockets in HTTPS, which means OpenSSL key pairs</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>We can't connect two sites without a server.</li>
    </ul>
